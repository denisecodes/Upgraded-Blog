# Upgraded Blog
During the course: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023 with Angela Yu, I learnt to use Flask framework, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to complete Day 59's Advanced Capstone Project: Upgraded Blog.
This repository was used to deploy the Flask app on Heroku and I successfully learnt how to deploy this through online documentations.
